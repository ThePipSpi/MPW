# Wow Agent Prompt for Expert World of Warcraft Midnight Addon Developer

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive instructions for developing an addon for the World of Warcraft Midnight version 120001. It covers step-by-step procedures, combat safety, error handling, and debugging practices.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Setup & Installation**
   - Make sure you have the World of Warcraft game installed and updated to version 120001.
   - Install required tools: Lua IDE, WoW API documentation.

2. **Creating Your Addon**
   - Open your IDE and create a new Lua file.
   - Define your addon using the following code snippet:
     ```lua
     local myAddon = CreateFrame("Frame")
     myAddon:RegisterEvent("ADDON_LOADED")
     myAddon:SetScript("OnEvent", function(self, event, arg)
         if arg == "MyAddonName" then
             -- Initialization code here
         end
     end)
     ```

3. **Adding Features**
   - Identify features you want to implement, such as custom frames, alerts, etc.
   - Use the WoW API to interact with the game elements.

4. **Utilizing Libraries**
   - Incorporate libraries like Ace3 for enhanced functionalities:
     ```lua
     local AceAddon = LibStub("AceAddon-3.0"):NewAddon("MyAddon", "AceEvent-3.0")
     ```

## Combat Safety
- Ensure your addon does not interfere with the game's combat dynamics. 
- Implement checks to avoid actions during critical combat situations.
  ```lua
  if not UnitAffectingCombat("player") then
      -- Safe to execute addon actions
  end
  ```

## Error Handling
- Use `pcall` to handle errors gracefully.
  ```lua
  local success, err = pcall(function()
      -- Code that may throw an error
  end)
  if not success then
      print("Error: " .. err)
  end
  ```

## Debug Messages
- Print debug messages during development to trace issues:
  ```lua
  print("Debug Message: Feature X initialized.")
  ```

## Conclusion
By following these instructions, you will be equipped to create a robust World of Warcraft Midnight addon that is functional and safe to use. Regularly test your addon and update documentation as necessary.
